# My current nvim setup
My daily nvim-conf started to be bloated and britle. Also it contained tons of functionality that I had added just for testing and never got rid of. So I purged the confs and started again.

I copied initial state from Radley Lewis, but simplied it little bit further, since I feel that I do not want to have any kind of terminal activity in my editor. Also made some heretical additions and changes to keymaps.
